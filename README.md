# MINI-ATM-machine


Welcome to the Mini ATM Machine project! This lightweight console application simulates basic ATM banking transactions in C. Perfect for learning core programming concepts like input validation, conditional logic, and menu-driven interfaces, this project is your stepping stone towards building more advanced financial applications. Dive in and explore how a simple C program can replicate real-world banking operations with ease!

## Features
User authentication with a preset PIN

Check current account balance

Withdraw money with balance and input validation

Deposit money with input validation

Simple and clear menu interface

Robust input reading for integers and floats to prevent invalid input crashes

Getting Started
Prerequisites
A C compiler (e.g., gcc)

Basic knowledge of compiling and running C programs on your system

Compilation Instructions
To compile the program, use:

bash
gcc -o mini_atm mini_atm.c
Replace mini_atm.c with the filename containing the program code.

## Running the Program
Run the compiled executable:

bash
./mini_atm
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your PIN and select options from the menu.

Usage
Enter the PIN 1234 when prompted to access the ATM menu.

Choose from options 1 to 4 to check balance, withdraw, deposit, or exit.

For withdrawals and deposits, input positive numerical amounts.

Invalid inputs or insufficient balance will show appropriate error messages.

## Limitations
The PIN is hard-coded and not secure for real applications.

Only a single user/account is supported.

No transaction history or file/database storage implemented.

## License
This project is for educational purposes only and is free to use and modify.
